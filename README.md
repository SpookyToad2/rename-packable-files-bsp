# Rename Packable Files

What does it do? Renames files that start/end with:
_particles.txt
_level_sounds.txt
_russian.txt
_english.txt
_finnish.txt
_german.txt
.nav
soundscapes_
menu_photos_

# Usage

Why this is a thing? When you have a map with 6+ files to rename while packing, it becomes really painful to rename them, especially vgui textures.

After launch, be sure to check config.txt. You should write your OWN path to tf folder. If not, it will give an error.
Then type your original map name that is already existing
After that, type map name of next version, for example, you change your map from dr_bog_v2 to dr_bog_v2a, you should type there dr_bog_v2a and in original mapname dr_bog_v2.
Then it will write down files that got changed.

Simple isn't it huh?
