What does it do? Renames files that start/end with:
* _particles.txt
* _level_sounds.txt
* _russian.txt
* _english.txt
* _finnish.txt
* _german.txt
* .nav
* soundscapes_
* menu_photos_

Why this is a thing? When you have a map with 6+ files to rename while packing, it becomes really painful to rename them, especially vgui textures.

* check config.txt. You should write your OWN path to tf folder. If not, it will give an error.
* type your original map name that is already existing
* type map name of next version, for example, you change your map from dr_bog_v2 to dr_bog_v2a, you should type there dr_bog_v2a and in original mapname dr_bog_v2.
* it will write down files that got changed.

Simple isn't it huh?
